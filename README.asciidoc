It's still cooking. Here's a quick taste to whet your appetite:

[source,shen]
----
(load "shen-test.shen")

(testing "(vector N)"
  given
    N is 3
    V is (vector N)
  verify
    V satisfies vector?
    (limit V) is N)

(testing "(<-vector V N)"
  given V is (vector-> (vector 2) 1 a-previously-stored-value)
  verify
    (<-vector V 1) is a-previously-stored-value
    (<-vector V -1) raises an error
    (<-vector V 0) raises "cannot access 0th element of a vector"
    (<-vector V 2) raises "vector element not found"
    (<-vector V 3) raises an error)
